# ff4j-spring-boot-starter-webflux-sample

This is a webflux starter with the following demonstration:
- Webapi
- Open API
> NOTE: We are not yet fully supporting reactive programming, so the web console is not available yet. The ff4j-spring-boot-starter-webflux is still a work in progress since we will need a store that is reactive.

## How to build?

> `mvn clean install`

## How to start?

> `mvn spring-boot:run`

The application will be booted with **netty** at http://localhost:8081
